## Description

The aim of this project was to build an API for a social network web application. For this purpose, a working Express.js API was configured to use Mongoose ODM to interact with a MongoDB database. This application allows a user share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Working on this project helped me gaininng further understanding of how to work with unstructured data using MongoDB.

## Installation

To create this app, Mongoose and Express.js packages were installed.

## Usage

This app may be used to create and retrieve information from the database, such as information on all users, their thoughts, reactions and friend list. In addition, users and thoughts can be updated and all entries can be removed.
